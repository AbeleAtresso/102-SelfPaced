# Demo: Publishing a learning journal

Students are learning how to create a brand-new web site with GitHub Pages, with minimal instruction. 

## Demo Instructions

1. Check out the [GitHub Pages intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY), which is also embedded in the GH Pages homepage.
  

### Steps to eventually follow

1. You'll need to be signed in to GitHub
2. Create a new repo, named `learning-journal`
    - If you already have something there, move it, or use a burner account.
3. Include a README when making the repo
4. Publish with GH pages, pick a theme you like
5. Check out your fancy new live site!
    - Raw content visible at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/learning-journal/README.md`
    - Rendered, themed page at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/learning-journal/`
6. Modify the Markdown, and see the changes get deployed (after about a min)
7. Convert the content into a home page for a learning journal
    - Briefly introduce yourself, and link to your GitHub profile
    - Explain what the site is about (it's a learning journal)
    - Explain Growth Mindset in your own words
    - New pages will be added to the site as we learn new things
