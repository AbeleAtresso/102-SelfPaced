# Demo: Structure with Semantic HTML

## Demo Instructions

Check out the lab instructions: Students will be building their own site. 

For the demo(in the video), I will follow the steps of the lab, but with a distinctly problem domain. I will select something like "Pizza Perfection" or "Pet Adoption Service" or "Best Happy Hour Spots".

Students, you shoule be able to tell an instructor about the reading pertaining to understanding their audience (personas), wireframing, and structuring the page. Select 1 persona to create for. Wireframe an "everypage" site, with boxes to represent the usual layout of a page.

Then header, h1, nav, ul, li, a, main, h2s, footer. Optionally: aside, section, article.
